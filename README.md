# HackRU Marketing and Design Directors' Guide

## Hello! :wave:

Firstly, congratulations on becoming MnD director! Being a director here at HackRU involves a lot of responsibilities, but I can assure you that it'll all pay off in the end. There is no better feeling, especially on this team, to see the fruits of your labor come to life during the hackathon. Whether you're doing this to see the smiles on hackers' faces while they code up the next Google, or to learn about how such a big student-run event is run, or to extend your leadership and communication skills within your arsenal, being a director has its perks. Let's get started!

## About this guide :notebook_with_decorative_cover:

I've written this guide so that you, as a new director, will not get overwhelmed about the tasks and duties that are expected of you throughout the semester. This guide is sectioned chronologically in respect to the begin date of the next HackRU, with miscellaneous tips and tricks scattered throughout. Think of it as a schedule you should aim to follow so that everything gets done in a timely manner. Of course, no guide is perfect, and this one isn't an exception. Some things and responsibilities will be missing from this guide (as the semester progresses, new ideas and thoughts for MnD will arise that will incur extra duties) so it's good to give yourself some leeway. Furthermore, this guide is ever-changing, as we learn more every semester and improve upon past mistakes. Feel free to note down anything you'd like to add to this guide and submit a pull request, or simply make a copy of this repo, add your suggestions, and pass it down to the next generation of MnD directors!

## Overview :crystal_ball:

Here's a general overview of what should be done as HackRU draws closer. Each of the suggested deadlines are respective to the beginning date of your current semester. For example, if you're currently planning for a Fall-semester HackRU (which traditionally begins mid-October), then 2 weeks before launch places the task due at the beginning of October. Use these deadlines to plan your own specific due dates for your team and organizers.
